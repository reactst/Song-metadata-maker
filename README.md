It's developed under the "eyed3" library and is fully compliant to it. For any changes to the code, read the documentation (https://eyed3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
The main function is to extract and write metadata from file names to ID1/2/3 data on .mp3 files.
# Requirement
All thats needed is the internal os library and the external eyed3 library which you can get by typing in your terminal

    pip install eyed3
    
This code is maintained and created by me. Feel free to make push and merge requests to improve the code. I will try to review code changes asap.
